# PCB Defects Detection Device

This repository contains the code and resources for a PCB defects detection device. The project utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning models to identify and classify defects in printed circuit boards (PCBs). 

## Overview

The PCB defects detection device is designed to automate the inspection process, ensuring high-quality standards in PCB manufacturing. The device employs a camera to capture images of PCBs and uses a trained model to detect various types of defects.

## Features

- **Computer Vision**: The project leverages computer vision to process and analyze images of PCBs. This involves techniques such as image enhancement, feature extraction, and object detection.
- **Model Training**: A machine learning model is trained on a dataset of PCB images with labeled defects. The model learns to identify and classify defects based on patterns in the images.
- **PCB Schematic and Design**: The repository includes the PCB schematic and design files, providing a comprehensive guide to the hardware setup.
- **Enclosure Design**: Design files for the device enclosure are also included, ensuring a complete package for building the physical device.
- **Web App**: The code for the web application used to interact with the device is also available, allowing for real-time monitoring and analysis through a user-friendly interface.
