# PCB Defects Detection Device

This repository contains the code and resources for a PCB defects detection device. The project utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning models to identify and classify defects in printed circuit boards (PCBs). 

## Overview

The PCB defects detection device is designed to automate the inspection process, ensuring high-quality standards in PCB manufacturing. The device employs a camera to capture images of PCBs and uses a trained model to detect various types of defects.

## Features

- *Defect Detection:* Identifies multiple PCB defects using a trained YOLOv8 model.
- *Component Placement Verification:* Compares PCB images to detect misaligned or missing components.

## Enclosure Design 

### üèó Key Considerations
The enclosure was designed to optimize functionality, ease of use, and performance:

1. **Mounting for Camera and PCB**
   - Dedicated mounting points secure the camera and PCB for stable inspection.
   
2. **Acrylic Flat Surface**
   - Provides a clear, stable platform for precise PCB inspection.

3. **Adjustable Camera Height**
   - An aluminum bar allows users to set the optimal distance for capturing detailed images.

4. **Ring of Light**
   - Ensures uniform illumination, eliminating shadows for accurate defect detection.

5. **On/Off Button**
   - Controls the power supply, enhancing convenience and safety.
